Automated Insurance Assistant (AIA) is a desktop application that helps insurance agents manage their client contacts.
Instead of hiring a secretary to handle day-to-day tasks, AIA can help you achieve the following:
- Catalogue and easily retrieve saved data on clients based on specific categories
- Keep track of important events and time-sensitive to-do tasks for each client (e.g. client birthdays)
- Keep records of previous interactions with each client

Usage of this application is optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still displaying information to users in an intuitive manner, through a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, AIA can significantly reduce the amount of time spent on retrieving saved information for each client that might have been saved on many different sources previously.

This user guide offers the following to insurance agents or other users trying to learn how to use the application:
- A quick start to running the application
- All available features
- Examples on how to use each feature

### Use of in-text formatting
Bold words refer to commands to be performed by users.

e.g. **cd** will refer to the "change directory" command in CLI.


Words in quotations are files, file types or dependencies.

e.g. "exe" refers to the executable file type used on Windows.

## Overview of the Graphical User Interface (GUI)

Our GUI is designed to be clean and easy to read so that you can start work on your clients right away.

<img src="images/userguideimages/UIMarkup.png" alt="Ui"/>

You can simply type your commands in the command box and upon pressing enter, the result display will show you
more information on what has been done.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb:
**Tip:**
The contact list is sorted in chronological order.
The earliest contact added will be on the top, while the latest contact added will be at the bottom.
</div>

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Markup words in `UPPER_CASE` are the information to be entered by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is an information which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/Client` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/Client`, `t/Client t/PremiumMember` etc.

* User input can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* User input can include leading and trailing spaces.<br>
  e.g. these are acceptable inputs <code>delete &nbsp; &nbsp; 7 &nbsp; &nbsp;</code> or <code>tag 1 t/ someTag</code>

* If an input is expected only once in for a specific command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of
  the input will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* <a name="a-date-format" />Dates should be in "YYYY-MM-DD" format, unless stated otherwise. Single digits should be zero padded.<br>
  e.g. `2022-05-17`, `2021-01-01` and `2011-10-10` are in the correct format with zero padding, while `2022-5-17` and `2021-1-1` are in the wrong format as they do not have a zero padding for single digit months and/or days.

* <a name="a-tag-name" />Tag names should be alphanumeric. In other words, it should only contain letters (a-z, A-Z) and numbers (0-9). Spaces are not allowed.

* <a name="a-index" />`INDEX` used in the different commands refer to the index number shown in the displayed contact list.

  ❗The `INDEX` must be a positive integer i.e. 1,2,3,...<br>
  If the integer is too large (i.e. greater than 2,147,483,647), we will not consider it an integer.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Adding a contact: `add`

When you meet a new potential client, and you managed to get their contact information, you can `add` them as a contact in the application.

* Upon adding a person, a default recently interacted date and description would be automatically generated.
  * The default date would be the day the contact was added, and default description would be "First Interaction".

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS b/BIRTH_DATE [t/TAG]…​`
* `BIRTH_DATE` should be in the [specified date format](#a-date-format).
* `TAG` should be in the [specified format](#a-tag-name).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb:
**Tip:**
A person can have any number of tags (including 0)
</div>

Examples:
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 b/1970-01-01` adds the contact with only the compulsory information provided.
  > <img src="images/userguideimages/AddCommandWithoutTag.png" alt="Ui"/>
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 b/1970-01-01 t/Client t/BasicMember` adds the contact with the compulsory information provided and the optional information.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Editing a contact: `edit`

If you realise a client's information in the application is outdated and needs to be updated, you can update the
information using the `edit` command.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [b/BIRTH_DATE]
[t/TAG]…​`

* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`.
* `INDEX` must be in the [specified format](#a-index).
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* `BIRTH_DATE` should be in the [specified date format](#a-date-format).
* `TAG` should be in the [specified format](#a-tag-name).
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e. adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the person’s tags by typing `t/` without
  specifying any tags after it.

Examples:
* `edit 7 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
  > <img src="images/userguideimages/EditCommandWithoutTag.png" alt="Ui"/>
* `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` edits the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Finding contacts by name: `find`

Scrolling through a whole list of people to find a specific client takes a long time. Instead, you can `find` people using keywords of their name.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g. `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned.
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

Examples:
* `find John` returns `john tan` and `John Doe`
  > <img src="images/userguideimages/FindCommand.png" alt="Ui"/>
* `find alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`<br>
  > <img src="images/userguideimages/FindCommandMultiple.png" alt="Ui"/>

[Return to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

If a contact entry is no longer relevant, you can `delete` the specified contact from the application.

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd contact in the application.
* `find Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st contact in the results of the `find` command.

[Return to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

* `INDEX` must be in the [specified format](#a-index).
* `DATE` should be in the [specified date format](#a-date-format).
